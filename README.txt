The digital reconstruction of an image from its projections has become an extremely important application of image processing. Medical technology especially has made use of tomographic images for diagnosing tissue maladies, flow imaging, molecular diffusion, and even spatially localized spectroscopy. The advantage of these techniques is that these applications are non-invasive (i.e., cross section images of a body can be created without surgical investigation). Purpose of this project is to develop an algorithm in Matlab to obtain tomographic image reconstruction from projections using various filters, in order to extract different outcomes.
